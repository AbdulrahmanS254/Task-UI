## Download and Installation

Develop:

* Install via npm: `npm i`

## Usage

Use `npm run dev` to compile and serve the build directory in real-time. It reloads every time there's a change. Then view the website at [https://localhost:9008](https://localhost:9008)

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Advanced Usage

Clone the source files of the theme and navigate into the theme's root directory. Run `npm install` and then run `npm run dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `package.json` file to see which scripts are included.

#### npm Scripts

* `npm run build` builds the project - this builds assets, HTML, JS, and CSS into `dist`
* `npm run dev` runs the project, launches a live preview in your default browser, and watches for changes made to files in `src`

You must have npm installed in order to use this build environment.
